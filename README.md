# presenting-data-insight-in-postgresql
This project involves presenting data insight of currently received donations from different donors. Two
data sets from a charity organization (Education for All) were provided by the 10Alytic team, namely
‘Donation data’ and ‘Donor data’, both of which contain different pieces of information related to donors’ biodata and their donations.
In addition, the business problem is to devise strategies of increasing funds for Education for All charity
organizations, using the provided data. Specifically, the tasks include increasing the number of donors,
increasing the donation frequency, and the donation amount itself.
